# üöß The Pok√©mon Combat Stats Lab: An Analytics Engineering Project üöß

This repository contains a complete Analytics Engineering project designed to demonstrate key competencies in the modern data stack. The goal is to transform a raw Pok√©mon dataset into a reliable, tested, and analysis-ready data product, following software engineering best practices applied to data.

## üìà Project Vision

The objective is not merely to analyze Pok√©mon data, but to build a robust **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)** pipeline from scratch. This project serves as a tangible proof of my ability to:

- Ingest and clean data using Python.
- Model data for analysis in a data warehouse (PostgreSQL).
- Apply engineering rigor (version control, testing, documentation) using dbt.
- Tell a compelling story with the resulting data.

## üéØ Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - Key Questions

This project focuses on answering three key questions that demonstrate the ability to turn raw data into business insights. Each question corresponds to a specific data mart built with dbt.

1. **Archetype Analysis: What are the most common combat archetypes?**
    - **Objective:** Classify each Pok√©mon into an archetype (e.g., "Tank", "Glass Cannon", "Sweeper") based on the distribution of their combat stats.
    - **Business Simulation:** Segmenting products into categories to understand the market landscape.

2. **Efficiency Analysis: Which Pok√©mon are the most statistically efficient for their cost?**
    - **Objective:** Create an `efficiency_score` (e.g., `base_total / base_egg_steps`) and rank Pok√©mon to identify those offering the most power for less "investment".
    - **Business Simulation:** Calculating the "return on investment" of different products or assets.

3. **Niche Analysis: Who are the "defensive specialists"?**
    - **Objective:** Identify the Pok√©mon that are resistant to the most types of attacks, finding those that dominate a defensive niche.
    - **Business Simulation:** Identifying products that hold a competitive advantage in a specific market segment.
